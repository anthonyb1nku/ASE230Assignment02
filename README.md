# Our Amazing Team Website

Welcome to our "Our Amazing Team" website! This project is all about showcasing the wonderful members of our team and their unique skills, experience, and interests.

## What This Project Is

This is a small website that displays information about each team member. You can see a quick overview of everyone's name, job title, and profile picture on the main page. By clicking on a team member, you can view a more detailed profile, including:

- **Work Experience**: Learn about the different jobs and roles each team member has had.
- **Skills**: See the tools and technologies they are great at.
- **Education**: Check out their educational background.
- **Interests**: Find out what hobbies or activities they enjoy outside of work.

## How to Use It
